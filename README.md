  * It is essetially a BFS algorithm that is used for a Bipartite graph.
  * It records the paths until it finds a match.
  * My own hashtable from homework 2 is implemented to store the actNodes and movieNodes.
  * Prime number calculator and queue algorithms are developed. (They are inspired by some algorithms online.)
  * It can be optimised in the future.
